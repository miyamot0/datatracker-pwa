The DataTracker program is designed to provide considerable flexibility in how data are collected and managed. This flexibility allows you to structure your data in a way that makes sense for your specific needs and research questions. However, there are several critical and recommended organizational structures to follow to ensure that data are easily accessible and manageable. This document provides an overview of the recommended organizational structure for data within the DataTracker program and outlines some general rules to follow when using the program.

### Approving DataTracker access

DataTracker is a website at its core--it does not have access to your hard drive as an installable program would. For this reason, you are prompted to approve the program access to **a specific** folder on your hard drive whenever you use it. This is happen once **every time** you use the program for security purposes. As a general practice (Note: which can be disabled), you program will prompt you to use a Folder (wherever it is located) named DataTracker (e.g., "DataTracker" folder on your Desktop). This is largely as a prompt for users not to accidentally load a "Group" folder as if it were a "DataTracker" folder. This can be disabled, but for good practice, it is kept as a default setting.

### Some General Rules for Working with DataTracker Data

Many aspects of the program can be customized to fit your specific needs (e.g., permissions for central folder, allowing for deletion of folders). However, there are certain types of behavior that are likely to cause problems or errors when using the program. The following are some general rules to follow when working with data in the DataTracker program.

#### Hand-editing data files is not a good idea

The program saves files in JSON format, which is a universal data format that can be read by many different programs. It can be read from software such as browsers, statistical software, programming languages, etc. If you attempt to edit this file by hand, without knowing the implications of what you are changing, you will cause problems when attempting to archive/read/summarize that data in the future.

When in doubt--use the interface to manage/delete files.

#### Dragging and Dropping Folders in DataTracker Folder is not a good idea

Certain operations in the DataTracker program are less impactful than others. For example, adding a new folder to a group with a Participant's ID as the title is unlikely to be problematic. However, copy/pasting/renaming folders is likely to be problematic because certain aspects of the program will _expect_ certain folders to be in certain locations. This is particularly relevant for the **Session Builder**, since it will attempt to _remember_ recent sessions and conditions that may no longer exist if you have edited/deleted those folder.

If you make major changes to the folder structure, it introduces significant risks of program error.

#### Copying a Keyboard (\*\*.json File) is Probably Okay

It is often the case that a common set of targets is shared across Participants in a study. In this case, it is likely that you will want to copy a Keyboard file from one Participant to another. This is generally okay, but it is important to remember that the Keyboard file _must be in the correct location_.

If you copy a Keyboard file to the wrong location, it will (1) not be accessible in the **Keyboard Designer** or **Session Designer** and (2) could cause the program to crash if the program reads it thinking it is a data file (e.g., when calculating Reliability or summarizing rates).

#### Creating Evaluation Conditions by Hand is Probably Okay

It is likely that certain types of conditions will be used across Participants for a given **Evaluation**. For example, a "Baseline" condition is likely to be used for all Participants in a study. In this case, it is likely that you will want to create a "Baseline" by hand for each of the Participants. This is generally okay, but it is important to remember that the **Condition** folder _must be in the correct location_ and _must be empty_.

#### Copying Reliability Files is Okay

As a working default, files for the Reliability data collector will need to be moved to a central location for analysis. This is expected behavior, though it is important to remember that the Reliability file _must be in the correct location_ (i.e., correct **Evaluation** and **Condition**).

### Structure and Hierachy of Data Tracker Information

- Group Folder (e.g., clinic, study grouping, etc.)

  - Individual Folder (e.g., client name or identifier)

    - 'Keyboard A.json' File (File associated with keys/behavior codes)

    - Evaluation Folder (e.g., functional analysis, treatment evaluation)

      - 'settings.json' File (File remembering on-going session designs)

      - Condition Folder (e.g., baseline, treatment, etc.)

        - Session Data File, e.g. '[Session Number]_[Condition Name]_[Primary/Reliability].json' (File recording session performances)

### Descriptions for Each Level of File Hierarchy

As a working default, individual data files are organized semantically on your hard drive. This means that the structure of the data files on your hard drive should reflect the structure of the data in the program. This is done to make it easier to find and manage data files outside of the program. The following is a description of the different levels of the file hierarchy and what they represent.

#### Group-Level Folder (Grouping by Clinic, Study, etc.)

The highest organizational level is the **Group** folder, which serves as a container for all data related to a specific study, clinical group, or research project. Each Group folder can be named however you wish, though it is recommended to be short and easily discriminable. For example, a Group folder might be labeled "Novel Preference Study 2024" as a means of grouping individual that are specific to this study in this area on your hard drive.

#### Individual-Level Folder (Grouping by Individuals)

Within each Group folder, there are **Individual** folders that each representing a unique participant or subject. These folders are named after the individual they pertain to, often using a participant ID or name, such as "Participant_001" or "Subject_A." These folders contain all data collected for that specific individual throughout the study, which are further delineated in terms of specific procedures.

#### Evaluation-Level Folder (Grouping by Purpose of Data)

Nested within each Individual folder are **Evaluation** folders. Each Evaluation folder corresponds to a distinct procedure (e.g., functional analysis). For example, data for one individual may emerge from a preference assesment in one Evaluation folder and a treatment evaluation in another. These folders are labeled according to the procedure or assessment they contain, such as "Functional Analysis" or "Treatment Evaluation." This level organizes the data collected from each session.

#### Condition-Level Folder (Grouping by condition; e.g., baseline, treatment, etc.)

At the most granular folder level is the **Condition** folder. Each Condition folder represents a specific condition, task, or experimental setup under which the individual's behavior was recorded during the evaluation. For example, a Condition folder might be named "Baseline" or "Intervention" to distinguish between data collected in varying contexts within a specific evaluation (e.g., conditions of functional analysis).
