The **Evaluation** folders, which are found within respective **Individual** folders, are essential for organizing data from specific sessions conducted with a client/participant. These folders capture snapshots of a participant's behavior in a specific context (e.g., assessment vs. treatment) at distinct points in time. Each **Evaluation** folder is typically labeled according to the procedure or method. For example, one evaluation might consist of a "Functional Analysis" while another might consist of a "Treatment Evaluation." This naming convention helps researchers and clinicians quickly identify the purpose of each Evaluation and understand the context from which recorded data had emerged.

The primary function of the **Evaluation** folder is to keep data from different contexts distinct and organized, making it easier for clinicians/researchers to analyze behavioral changes over time. This is particularly important in studies focusing on behavioral interventions, such as those targeting autism. For example, if a participant with autism is participating in a functional communication intervention, the **Evaluation** folder (e.g., "FC Treatment Evaluation") would contain data from the specific sessions and conditions where behavior was measured. This approach allows clinicians and researchers to compare behavior over time, compare changes across conditions/contexts, and adjust intervention as needed.

For example, in a study examining the effectiveness of a new behavioral therapy for children with autism, a participant might participate in the evaluation of multiple behavior intervention approaches. For "Client_001," you could have **Evaluation** folders such as "Functional Analysis" (which would take place before a treatment were to be developed) and "Treatment Evaluation." Each **Evaluation** folder would contain data that are associated with specific contexts and procedures (e.g., Baseline, Intervention A, Intervention B). This structured approach ensures that data from each session is easily accessible and comparable, which is crucial for drawing inferences about specific arrangements and their effects on behavior.

The rationale behind using **Evaluation** folders in this fashion is to facilitate a structured and understandable organization of data. By keeping data from each **Evaluation** in a designated folder, clinicians/researchers can maintain a clear and orderly record of behavior and the specific conditions under which it was observed. This organization is particularly useful for behavioral assessments and intervention evaluations, where tracking changes in behavior over time is essential for understanding behavior.
