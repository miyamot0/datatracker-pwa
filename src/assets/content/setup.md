First, thank you for your interest in the DataTracker data collection tool.

The DataTracker program is the result of various collaborations amongst single-case experimental design (SCED) researchers over the past several decades. The core aim of the program is to be _simple_, _useful_, _consistent_, and _reliable_ for conducting realtime behavioral research and therapy. This documentation entry is designed to provide a brief overview of the software, the intended audience, common uses, and some of the conventions reflected in its design.

### Program Structure and Functionality

The DataTracker program is, at its core, is a **website**. Specifically, the website functions as a **Progressive Web Application** or "PWA". Although distinct from typical compiled computer programs, there are many similarities between PWAs and typical programs (e.g., those downloaded and installed from the internet or 'app' marketplaces). DataTracker works as any website would; However, it can be _installed_ on your computer and used as an offline program as well (e.g., 'pinned' to Dock, to Applications folder, etc.). This provide the flexibility of a website with the convenience of a traditional program.

The decision to adopt a PWA approach was designed to balance some modern considerations of SCED clinicians and researchers. This approach means the program can be accessed through a web browser like any other website, but it also has additional features that allow it to be installed on your device like a traditional application (i.e., can quickly access from your device's home screen). This is also a way to ensure that the program is always up-to-date, as it will automatically update whenever you are connected to the internet.

The DataTracker program is designed to be used on a **desktop or laptop computer**. Although it can be accessed on a mobile device, the interface is not optimized for smaller screens, and certain features are simply not supported on mobile systems (e.g., there is no access to a native file system). For the best experience, it is recommended to use the program on a larger laptop screen or external monitor, especially when many targets are being recorded simultaneously.

### Installation Options

You _should_ be able to install DataTracker on your machine by using a browser of your choosing. However, the program is most heavily testing for use with **Google Chrome** and **Microsoft Edge**. Apple support for PWA's is somewhat mixed (i.e., installing through **Apple Safari** is limited in most versions of MacOS). Although native options for MacOS are more limited, it is possible to install DataTracker as a PWA through **Google Chrome** (i.e., it can be pinned to the MenuBar to emulate native app behavior).

As a general note, it is **not required** to 'install' DataTracker on your device. The program can be accessed through your browser like any other website. However, installing the program on your device can provide a more native experience and allow for quicker access to the program (e.g., added to Desktop/Menubar, wakelock during recording). The installation process is straightforward and can be done in a few clicks, so it is generally recommended by default.

#### Installation for Windows Users

##### Installation on Microsoft Edge (Recommended)

On a Windows machine, it is simplest to install DataTracker using **Microsoft Edge**. This is easiest for Windows users because there is no need to install any additional software (e.g., Google Chrome). You can install the program by selecting the 'Install' button on the home screen, or alternatively, you can install the program manually by selecting the 'Install' option in the browser menu.

##### Alternative Installation on Google Chrome

The installation of DataTracker on **Google Chrome** is also straightforward. This is largely the same process as with **Microsoft Edge**, but would require the installation of Google Chrome if you do not already have it on your machine.

#### Installation for MacOS Users

##### Installation on Google Chrome (Recommended)

Although native options for MacOS are possible, it is more universally supported to install DataTracker using **Google Chrome**. This is the most straightforward option for MacOS users, as it is among the most widely used browsers and is well-supported for PWA installations. You can install the program by selecting the 'Install' button on the home screen, or alternatively, you can install the program manually by selecting the 'Install' option in the browser menu.

##### Installation on Apple Safari

Installation on **Apple Safari** is only possible for those running the Sonoma build of MacOS. Additionally, this is not universally supported and may not be available in all regions. Should your machine meet the criteria for installation per Apple's standards, you would have to navigate to the DataTracker website and manually install the program as a PWA (i.e., File > "Add to Dock").
