The **Condition** folders, which are located within specific **Evaluation** folders, are critical for organizing data according to some specific condition or experimental arrangement under which behavior was observed. Separating observed data into these folders allows clinicians/researchers to differentiate between various scenarios or interventions that a client had participated within. Each **Condition** folder is labeled based on the particular arrangement/modification it represents, such as "Baseline" or "Intervention" in an intervention evaluation. This organization is especially useful in behavioral studies, where understanding the impact of different conditions on a participant's behavior is often essential (e.g., functional analysis across multiple conditions).

### Overview of Folder Structure (Nested within Evaluation Folder)

The purpose of the **Condition** folder is to provide a clear and organized way to separate data collected under different experimental circumstances. In studies focusing on behavioral interventions for children with behavior issues, this might include comparing a child's behavior during a baseline period (i.e., prior to exposure to intervention) to behavior observed during/after participating in intervention. For example, a "Baseline" **Condition** folder could contain data from sessions where the child's behavior was observed without any interventions in place. In contrast, an "Intervention" **Condition** folder would include data from sessions where specific behavioral strategies, such as positive reinforcement, were applied. This separation allows researchers to make clear comparisons between conditions, helping to identify which interventions are most effective.

For example, consider a study aimed at reducing aggressive behavior in children through a structured intervention program. For "Participant_001", the **Evaluation** folder for "Treatment Evaluation" might include two **Condition** folders: "Baseline" and "Intervention." The "Baseline" folder would contain would contain data recordings were the child's behavior was monitored without any intervention (e.g., could capture rates of aggression in these settings). The "Intervention" folder, on the other hand, would house similar types of data collected when specific behavioral techniques, such as reward systems, were actively being used to manage and reduce aggression. By comparing the data in these two folders, researchers can assess how the child's behavior changed from the "Baseline" to the "Intervention" phase, providing insights into the effectiveness of the strategies employed.

The rationale behind using "Condition" folders is to ensure that data collected under different experimental conditions is kept distinct and organized. This is vital for accurately analyzing the impact of various ecological arrangements on behavior. By maintaining a clear distinction between conditions, researchers can avoid confusion and ensure that their analyses are based on accurate, well-organized data. This structure also supports the reproducibility of the study, as it allows other researchers to clearly see how each condition was defined and assessed. In behavioral intervention studies, where nuanced differences between conditions can significantly influence outcomes.

### Creating and Deleting Condition Folders

To create a new **Condition** folder, you can do so by clicking the "Create Condition" button available within the **Session Designer** page associated with the **Evaluation**. The **Session Designer** page is where you define the structure of the session, including the conditions under which data will be collected. There is an "Add Condition" button that allows you to create a new **Condition** folder. Clicking this button will prompt a dialog box to appear, asking you to enter a name for the new **Condition** folder. Once you have provided the desired name (e.g., "Baseline"), the new **Condition** folder will be added to the program's hierarchy. You can then begin populating the **Condition** folder with data files, notes, and other relevant information from that condition. An illustration of this interface is displayed below:
