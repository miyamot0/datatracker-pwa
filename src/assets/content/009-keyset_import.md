The DataTracker program allows for the importing of an _existing_ **KeySet** saved in the program to facilitate quick and efficient design of session conditions and behavior recording. In certain situations, it may be more efficient to import a **KeySet** from other individuals rather than re-create a new one (e.g., amending a KeySet to include a new response to track). This article will provide a brief overview of the process of importing **KeySets** in DataTracker.

### Option A: Manual Creation

The first option is to manually create **KeySets** by selecting the desired keys from the keyboard. This is essentially creating a _new_ KeySet from scratch. This is probably the most reasonable way to begin when you are working with targets and procedures that are uncommon or that you have not previously used with DataTracker. Users can begin this process by pressing the "Create" button in the relevant section of the program. A visual of this section is provided below:

### Option B: Importing KeySets

The second option is to import **KeySets** that have been previously saved in the program. This is the focus of this article. Within the 'Manage KeySets' section for a specific individual, there is an option to 'Import' from the various **KeySets** that currently exist in the total DataTracker directory (i.e., across all groups and individuals). For the purposes of the import process, the **KeySets** displayed are those that have been saved in the directories of _other_ individuals.

The 'KeySet Import' page provides a list of all available **KeySets** that can be imported. This includes **KeySets** from other individuals, which can be useful for quickly setting up a new individual with similar targets or procedures to an existing one. These can be imported individually or in bulk, depending on needs, by selecting the relevant checkboxes next to each KeySet. Once these are imported, the list will refresh to reflect the newly added **KeySets**. A visual of this section is provided below:

<div align="center" width="100%">
    <img src="/docs/preview_import_keyset_ui.png" alt="Image of DataTracker KeySet import UI"/>
</div>

Once imported, the **KeySet** will be in the relevant **Individual** directory and will be available for editing and/or immediate use.
