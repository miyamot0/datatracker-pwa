The DataTracker program allows for the importing of _existing_ **KeySets** saved in the program to facilitate quick and efficient design of session conditions and behavior recording. In certain situations, it may be more efficient to import **KeySets** from other individuals rather than re-create a new keyset. This article will provide a brief overview of the process of importing **KeySets** in DataTracker. As a brief review, DataTracker provides multiple ways to create **KeySets**. A visual example of this interface is provided below:

### Option A: Manual Creation

The first option is to manually create **KeySets** by selecting the desired keys from the keyboard. This is essentially creating a _new_ keyset from scratch. This is probably the most reasonable way to begin when you are working with targets and procedures that are uncommon or that you have not previously used with DataTracker.

### Option B: Importing Keysets

The second option is to import **KeySets** that have been previously saved in the program. This is the focus of this article. Within the 'Manage Keysets' section for a specific individual, there is an option to 'Import Keyset' from the various **KeySets** that currently exist in the DataTracker directory. Specifically, these are **KeySets** that have been saved in the directories of _other_ individuals. A visual of this section is provided below:

</div>

The 'Import Keyset' page will provide a review of various **KeySets** that are available for import. The user can select the desired keyset and import it into the current individual's keyset list. This is a quick and efficient way to create **KeySets** for a new individual that is similar to an existing individual. Pressing the relevant button to import the keyset will add the keyset to the current individual's directory. The keyset will then be available for use and editing in the 'Manage Keysets' section.
