The DataTracker provides a way to view the data from an **Evaluation**. This is useful for inspecting the data that was collected during for a session as well as across various sessions and conditions (e.g., Attention, Demand conditions of functional analysis). Options for working with saved **Evaluation** data can be found by selecting the "View Evaluation Data" from the dropdown menu in the **Evaluation** page. Clicking on this entry in the dropdown will navigate to the **View Evaluation Data** page.

An example of a hypothetical evaluation is displayed below:

### Interpreting Saved Session Data

The **View Evaluation Data** page provides a table of the data collected during the **Evaluation**. The table provides information related to the _rate_ of behavior for "Frequency" keys and the _proportion_ of session time for "Duration" keys. When in doubt, the most clear and straightforward representation is the "Count" or "Seconds" recorded for each key.

#### Frequency Data Table

The frequency data table provides a summary of the data collected during the **Evaluation**. The data includes a "Count" for each Session and a _rate_ is calculated for the **Total Session Time**; however, this may or may not be the information most useful for a given **Evaluation**. For example, if the session incorporated **two timers**, you would likely wish to calculate rate based on the minutes recorded in either "Timer #1" or "Timer #2" rather than the "Main Timer".

#### Duration Data Table

The duration data table provides a summary of the data collected during the **Evaluation**. The data includes a "Seconds" for each Session and a _proportion_ of the **Total Session Time**; however, this may or may not be the information most useful for your **Evaluation**. For example, if the session incorporated **two timers**, you would likely wish to calculate the proportion of session based on the minutes recorded in either "Timer #1" or "Timer #2" rather than the "Main Timer".

### Exporting Data

The **View Evaluation Data** page provides an option to export the data collected during the **Evaluation**. The data can be exported as a CSV file or as a JSON file. In short, the CSV file type is best for viewing the data in a spreadsheet program, while the JSON file type is best for viewing the data in a text editor or for use in a programming environment. Multiple formats are provided to ensure that the data can be used in a variety of ways.
