The DataTracker program allows for the importing of _existing_ **Evaluations** saved elsewhere in the program to facilitate quick and efficient design of session conditions and behavior recording. In certain situations, it may be more efficient to import **Evaluations** from other individuals rather than re-create a new evaluation. For example, certain clinics may use a common baseline assessment protocol (e.g., derivative of functional analysis) across most individuals and constructing these repeatedly would be tedious and time-consuming.

This article will provide a brief overview of the process of importing **Evaluations** in DataTracker. As a brief review, DataTracker provides multiple ways to create **Evaluations**. These can be created manually or with the help of the 'Import Evaluation' feature

### Option A: Manual Creation

The first option is to manually create **Evaluations** is by using the associated button in the **Evaluations** page of DataTracker. This is essentially creating a _new_ evaluation from scratch. This is probably the most reasonable way to begin when you are working with targets and procedures that are uncommon or that you have not previously used with DataTracker.

### Option B: Importing Evaluations

The second option is to import **Evaluations** that have been previously saved in the program. For instance, this may be an evaluation used with _another_ client that is similar to the one you are currently working with. To begin, enter the 'Manage Evaluations' section for a specific individual. On this page, there is an option to 'Import Evaluation' from the various **Evaluations** that currently exist in the DataTracker directory. Specifically, these are **Evaluations** that have been saved in the directories of _other_ individuals. A visual of this section is provided below:

The 'Import Evaluation' page will provide a review of various **Evaluations** that are available for import. The user can select the desired evaluation and import it into the current individual's evaluation list. This is a quick and efficient way to create **Evaluations** for a new individual that is similar to an existing individual. Pressing the relevant button to import the evaluation will add the evaluation to the **current individual's** directory. The evaluation will then be available for use and editing in the 'Manage Evaluations' section. As a reminder, this is independent of the **KeySets** used in the program, and the import of existing **KeySets** is an independent process.
